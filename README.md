# license-compliance-test-cases
Test cases for license compliance tooling like FOSSA

Given a tool for license compliance:
* Check all targeted languages, e.g. Rust, PHP, etc
* Check all targeted licenses, e.g. AGPL, GPL 2.0, etc

A user of this repository would clone it, add to their tooling, and verify that compliance issues were detected.
